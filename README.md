# REST and Open API

The REST API is one of the most prominent architectural tools in modern Web Software Engineering. Virtually every web application or service relies on one or more REST APIs to manage data for applications. Because of this ubiquity, many technologies have been developed to assist developers in creating these APIs. This is what Swagger 3.0, or the Open API Spec is. To learn more about the history of Swagger/Open API, see the [about page](https://swagger.io/about/) on their website.
